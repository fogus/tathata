  "This is the public API for Tathata.  The API is designed to
   present the smallest possible set of functions for dealing with
   pods including:

   - An operation to mutate an ephemeral object contained in a pod.
   - An operation to fetch an ephemeral value from an object contained in a pod.
   - An operation to create a pod based on a policy.
   - An operation to coordinate fetches and mutations based on a policy.

   There's one other operation on pods not directly offered in this
   namespace.  That is, pods provide a mutable object -> value operation
   that may or may not be exposed via the `deref` protocol.  This
   exposure is left to the discretion of pod designers.  See the
   `fogus.kernel.tathata.protocols` namespace for more details on
   crafting new pods."

(defmacro via
  "Calls a method or function `op` through the given `pod` with
   the supplied arguments.  This macro is intended to be used
   for operations that might mutate the object held in the
   pod and guarded / coordinated by the pod's policy."

  "Calls a method or function `op` through the given `pod` with

  "Takes an object and a policy and returns an object having `Suchness`,

   on the dictates of the policy contained therein.  It's expected
   that the policy used for coordination extends the `Coordinator`
   protocol, otherwise a `AbstractMethodError` exception will be
   thrown.

   *note: This macro might be extended to throw a different error
   other than the stock `AbstractMethodError` one, which is a bit
   clunky.*"
